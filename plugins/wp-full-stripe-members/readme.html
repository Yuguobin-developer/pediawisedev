<h2>Make money from your WordPress website by creating subscriber only content</h2>

<h2>WP Full Stripe Members</h2>
<p>A fully featured membership plugin add-on for <a href="https://paymentsplugin.com" target="_blank"><strong>WP Full Stripe</strong></a> that allows you to
    create protected content that only subscribed members are allowed to view.<br/>Multiple membership tiers are available so you can offer different levels of membership, each one tied to a different
    subscription plan.  Members have their own 'My Account' page that allows them to update credit card details, change their membership plan and cancel their account.<br/>
    Be in total control of your protected content by simply selecting the option to make it subscriber only from the edit post page.  WP Full Stripe Members seamlessly integrates with WP Full Stripe and will
    automatically create member accounts for customers who subscribe to membership plans that you define.</p>
<h4>Features</h4>

    <li>Create member only content available exclusively to paying customers</li>
    <li>Seamlessly integrates with WP Full Stripe</li>
    <li>Manage member roles and subscription plans from the dashboard</li>
    <li>Multiple tiers of membership levels and option to allow member upgrades</li>

<h4>Requirements & Compatibility</h4>
<p>This plugin is an extension (add-on) for <a href="https://paymentsplugin.com" target="_blank">WP Full Stripe</a> and as such it <strong>requires</strong> <a href="https://paymentsplugin.com" target="_blank">WP Full Stripe</a>
    to be installed, activated and setup in order to work.  This plugin will not work without <a href="https://paymentsplugin.com" target="_blank">WP Full Stripe</a> installed.</p>
<p>This plugin was developed and tested on WordPress v5.4.2 and is also known to work on version v4.0.0.  The plugin will be updated in the future if Wordpress updates any functionality it relies upon. It will also work with any theme and minimal styling has been added which means
    it will take on your installed theme's styling.</p>
<h4>SSL</h4>
<p>It is highly recommended you use SSL with this plugin to provide extra security for your customers. Note: you must <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/domain-validation.aspx">buy an SSL certificate</a> to use HTTPS on your web server.</p>
<h4>Demo</h4>
<p>The demo is included alongside the WP Full Stripe demo.  You can see the member management pages on the WordPress admin by logging in as directed on the homepage of the demo.  The demo does not include a way to see the post protection mechanism - this is a new meta box on the create/edit post page that allows you to mark posts as protected plus the level of membership required to access them.</p>
